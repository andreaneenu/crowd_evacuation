# Project Abstract

The increasing number of refugees due to natural and man-made disasters presents significant challenges, particularly in ensuring the safe and efficient distribution of food in refugee camps. Panic-driven motion during food distribution often leads to overcrowding, collisions, and fatalities.

In this study, we model the food distribution process using a **crowd dynamics framework** to analyze how movement patterns contribute to injuries and deaths. Our simulations show that as food distribution begins, refugees rush toward the food distribution point, leading to high-density congestion and dangerous interactions.

We explore strategies to mitigate these risks by introducing **fixed obstacles near the food distribution point**. The results demonstrate that:

- A **single obstacle** can reduce fatalities by approximately **15%**.  
- An **optimized two-obstacle configuration** achieves up to a **70% reduction** in deaths.

Additionally, we examine the impact of varying **obstacle parameters**—such as size, placement, and gap distance, and discuss their effects on crowd flow. The findings suggest that **strategic obstacle placement** can significantly improve safety, offering a practical and low-cost intervention for refugee camps.

Future work could explore additional measures, such as **increasing the number of food distribution points**, to further enhance efficiency while addressing logistical constraints.
